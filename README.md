# Simple 3D Unity Game
### Project Goal
We plan on making a 3D game in Unity. The game should feature sound, music, functional physics, a lighting engine, player control, an adjustable camera, and textures for models as well as levels/terrains.
For now, the game we are imagining does not have any specific gameplay in mind, but as for potential ideas, a few ideas that we have as a group are:
* A whack-a-mole style party game where players can move around
* A Super Mario style game
* A first or third person shooter game
* Some other game involving a moveable player

The specific concept of the game will likely emerge after we implement basic mechanics such as player movement and collision. The final product will ideally be a proof of concept, meaning that bugs and lack of polish will likely exist depending on the scale of our game, but the game should be mostly bug free as well as fully playable.

### Required Materials and Technologies
We plan on using the following technologies/assets to implement our game:
* Unity
* C# Programming Language
* An IDE such as VS Code
* Royalty free music and sound effects from audioblocks.com
* Models from Unity Asset Store
